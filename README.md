# perlbrew-prc-dockerimage
This repository contains the dockerimage file for a container that would give you an environment that has perlbrew, perl, cpanm and dzil. It is intended to be helpful especially for [CPAN Pull Request Challenge](http://cpan-prc.org), hence the name.

# Instructions
Please refer to [this blog post](https://kyzn.org/2018-02-21-setup-your-computer-for-cpan-prc.html), especially the part titled "The Docker Way".
